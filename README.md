In our Year 2 Game Engine Architecture module we had to implement some mechanics from Remedy's Control in two game engines. 

This is the Unity version of that project. <br>

Controls:
   - Movement: WSAD
   - Run: Left Shift
   - Jump: Space
   - Launch: E
   - Shield: Q
   - Levitate: V
      - Levitate Up: Space
      - Levitate Down: Left Control
   - Switch Camera Side: R <br>
