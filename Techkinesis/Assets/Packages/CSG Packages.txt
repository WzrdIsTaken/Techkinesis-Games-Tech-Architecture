Kinda just a note for my future self in case I want to do CSG stuff again.

https://github.com/karl-/pb_CSG (for the actual operations)
https://github.com/Whinarn/UnityMeshSimplifier (so shapes remained shapelike)

The pb_CSG stuff works fine for normal shapes, but when you start to make more
complex ones then the simplifer comes in handy.
