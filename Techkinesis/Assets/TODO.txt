RIGHT NOW:
- Sheild
	- Allow player to launch shield objects if launch key is pressed
	- Min/max dist
- Levitate
	- Collision
	- Improve camera
	- Make it so that the player can't spin around a bunch (just press S and it will happen soon enough..)
- Improve launch code / optimise values

- Convert all variable comments in the abilities / player controller to tooltips
- Add slider that allows for the number of vertices in a cut away mesh to be added / removed

- objects in the shield / that were launched shouldn't be able to collide with the player

WOULD BE NICE
- Optimise the cutting of mesh - this tutorial could be used to help create some 'holes' where the rocks are pulled out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuP1fUPdxbo&list=PLPAgqhxd1Ib1YYqYnZioGyrSUzOwead17&index=11
- Catch stack overflow 
- Could prevent it on the floor with just a tag check. Floor could be dense concrete / steel and you can't pull it?

- Outline shader under accessability options https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEth0drTuyg (shader already imported if not doing this remove the package)
