RIGHT NOW:
- Sheild
	- Min/max dist. would be nice to do but i cant work it out rn. maybe get the the point in world space (not inside the sphere) then clamp its pos? idk dude this rarely happens its okkkkk
- Levitate
	- Collision
	- Improve camera - kinda done?
	- Make it so that the player can't spin around a bunch (just press S and it will happen soon enough..)
- Improve launch code / optimise values

- Convert all variable comments in the abilities / player controller to tooltips (say in writeup / github repo assume designer knows nothing)
- Add slider that allows for the number of vertices in a cut away mesh to be added / removed (ie smoother cut less lag)
- gizmos to allow designer to see whats lauchable

WOULD BE NICE
- Optimise the cutting of mesh - this tutorial could be used to help create some 'holes' where the rocks are pulled out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuP1fUPdxbo&list=PLPAgqhxd1Ib1YYqYnZioGyrSUzOwead17&index=11
- Catch stack overflow 
- Could prevent it on the floor with just a tag check. Floor could be dense concrete / steel and you can't pull it?
- Yeah dude not doing this its a complete rabit hole

- Have git dependencies (Unity Mesh Simplifier) - might need to solve this? ngl which lecturer doesn't have git, but maybe idk. Ask Simon

IMPORTANT
- shield / launch effect kinda bug out with levitating
- Hole shader

---

So:
- Levitation optimisation
- Shield / launch effect bugging out with levitation
- Hole cut shader / effect
- Gizmos on lauchable objects DONE
- Rocks have to deal damage
- Enemies have to deal damage
- Demo scene
- Check through code and tidy up project
