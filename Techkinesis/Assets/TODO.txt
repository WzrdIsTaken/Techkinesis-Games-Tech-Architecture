RIGHT NOW:
- Sheild
	- Min/max dist. would be nice to do but i cant work it out rn. maybe get the the point in world space (not inside the sphere) then clamp its pos? idk dude this rarely happens its okkkkk
- Levitate
	- Collision
	- Improve camera - kinda done?
	- Make it so that the player can't spin around a bunch (just press S and it will happen soon enough..)
- Improve launch code / optimise values
	- Make it so that the object speeds up more when travelling to the player like in the real control. It moves really fast!

- Convert all variable comments in the abilities / player controller to tooltips (say in writeup / github repo assume designer knows nothing)
- Add slider that allows for the number of vertices in a cut away mesh to be added / removed (ie smoother cut less lag)
- gizmos to allow designer to see whats lauchable

WOULD BE NICE
- Optimise the cutting of mesh - this tutorial could be used to help create some 'holes' where the rocks are pulled out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuP1fUPdxbo&list=PLPAgqhxd1Ib1YYqYnZioGyrSUzOwead17&index=11
- Catch stack overflow 
- Could prevent it on the floor with just a tag check. Floor could be dense concrete / steel and you can't pull it?

- Outline shader under accessability options https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEth0drTuyg (shader already imported if not doing this remove the package)

- Have git dependencies (Unity Mesh Simplifier) - might need to solve this? ngl which lecturer doesn't have git, but maybe idk. Ask Simon
