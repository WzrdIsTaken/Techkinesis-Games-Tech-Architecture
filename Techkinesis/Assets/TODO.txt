RIGHT NOW:
- Sheild
- Levitate
- Improve launch code / optimise values

WOULD BE NICE
- Optimise the cutting of mesh
- Catch stack overflow 
- Could prevent it on the floor with just a tag check. Floor could be dense concrete / steel and you can't pull it?

- Outline shader under accessability options https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEth0drTuyg (shader already imported if not doing this remove the package)
